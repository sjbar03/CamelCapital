	Our project is an algorithmic trading platform designed for buying and selling 
	securities, primarily stocks. It offers a comprehensive suite of features including
	backtesting functionality, live market data compatibility, and the implementation of 
	trading strategies.

        We have developed an interactive GUI which allows users to repeatedly run backtests
        on separate stocks and separate starting balances without being required to quit and
        restart the application. Custom charts display the trend in backtesting data and stock
        value over the last 1000 days of backtesting.

        Additionally, we have implemented real-time paper trading. Given a stock ticker, the
        real-time trading algorithm analyzes the stock price every minute to determine if it is 
        below a certain threshold, and if so, purchases the stock.

        Our refined trading algorithm leverages the Kelly-Criterion and assigns a risk profile
        at launch, allowing users more control over their fund allocation. We have also developed 
        a substantial test suite to ensure the correctness of our algorithms and system 
        infrastructure.
