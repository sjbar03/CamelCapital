This project uses Python files. Before beginning, check if you have Python installed with the terminal command

$ python --version

If you do not have Python installed, you can install it with Homebrew with:

$ brew install python

If you do not have Homebrew, you can download Python on this website:

https://www.python.org/downloads/


Several external packages are required to run this application. You can install all of them with opam:


$ opam install batteries
$ opam install bogue
$ opam install gsl
$ opam install ANSITerminal
$ opam install bisect_ppx
$ opam update
$ opam upgrade

Next, open up the CamelCapital folder with a command-line terminal. Once there, open the source code of the project with:

$ cd CC

Then run

$ dune build

If you get an error, try running:

$ dune clean
$ dune build

Example Usage:

For Backtesting: 

  To launch 10-year backtest tool (with gui):

  $ dune exec bin/main.exe -- gui
  
  Once the GUI opens, in the top left you can enter in a ticker and starting balance where it says "Enter starting balance"
  ie: AAPL 100000
      GME 200000
      
  Next to "Enter starting balance," there's also an option to designate your risk level as 1, 2, or 3.
  

  To run a 10-year backtest on a single ticker (no gui):

  $ dune exec bin/main.exe terminal
  
  For an example, you can try using AAPL as your ticker. 100000 as your desired starting capital, and 3 as your risk.
  
  
  
  If you don't want any interface, you may use only command line flags with

  $ dune exec bin/main.exe -- ticker <ticker_code> <starting_balance>
  
  ie: $ dune exec bin/main.exe -- ticker AMC 10000
      You will later be prompted for your risk level, try using "2"

For Paper Trading:

  To launch GUI:

  $ dune exec bin/realtime.exe -- -realtime gui

    - Once in the paper trading GUI, enter a ticker (ex. AAPL) in the top left and a press start. You won't see anything at the beginning, but after a few seconds, press refresh, and it should update.
    - The program continuously checks the price of a stock until it is under "True Range." Once it's under True Range, it stops the program (to purchase the stock).


  To start trading loop without GUI:

  $ dune exec bin/realtime.exe -- <ticker> -realtime
  
  ie. dune exec bin/realtime.exe -- AAPL -realtime
  
  Feel free to modify the starting balance in trader_state.txt
